# slogo

### Running the Program

 * Main class: 
   * src/main/java/slogo/Main.java

 * Data files needed: 
   * Path to Turtle Images: src/main/resources/turtleimages/
   * Path to Language Properties:src/main/resources/slogo/languages/
   * Path to Palette Properties:src/main/resources/slogo/palette/
   * Path to Help Documentation:data/helpXmls/
   * Path to Preferences XMLs: data/preferencesXmls/

 * Interesting data files:
    * In the examples data files there are a lot of cool and interesting data files that can be
   implemented in the program displaying the variety of different featurs that the program can do.
    * One of them that is interesting is the 'random_range.slogo' file that shows the random range
   command. However, in addition to the random range command, there are many other commands that 
   it works with to draw a completely random picture every time including making variables, to, fd,
   rt, and repeat commands.
   
    * The commands XML file is also interesting. This file is exceptionally long, but it maintains
   all the information necessary about all the commands that the program can run from the basic 
   movement commands to queries to booleans. This file is used to display the help documentation.
   There is also a comandos.xml file that is in spanish that is used to display the help
   documentation in spanish.

 * Key/Mouse inputs: 
   * The program mainly works through mouse inputs. The user can click on the buttons to run and 
   start the working IDE. It also needs the mouse input to access the buttons throughout within
   the program when its running such as the load, save, help, and submit/execute buttons. Also for
   dropdown menus. 
   * It uses mouse inputs also to directly interact with the turtle. The user can click on buttons
   to move the turtle and rotate it by a certain amount determined by them. The user can also hover
   over the turtle to get turtle specific information. If the user clicks on the turtle, the user
   will run a tell command.
   * Key inputs are important to type out and run commands. Also pressing enter when the user is 
   done typing out the command one way to execute a command.
